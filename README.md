# Keycloakmigration

This project is inspired by the database migration tool liquibase.
It aims to provide a similiar mechanism for Keycloak.

The migration hashes are stored in the attribute named 'migration' in the migration user.

TODOS:
- Add more commands
- Add gradle plugin
- Add sophisticated unit and integration Tests
- Test Keycloak with PostgreSQL instead of H2 backend.
